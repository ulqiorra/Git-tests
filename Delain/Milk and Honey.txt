The sun was golden flame, 
The air was sweet like honey; 
The grass was soft we made
A pledge to keep on running.
The clouds were shied away, 
The air was warm and damp; 
Oh on this golden day, 
You ripped my heart away.

It was the dawn of may, 
A lonely blackbird singing, 
Now the same melody, 
Brings back the pain... 

[Chorus]:
(Bring back the pain)
You'll get it, regret it
Take my advice! 
(Bring back the pain)
You'll get it, regret it
If you are wise! 
As long as you're forgetting all the wrong
Please look over your shoulder twice

The moon was silver light, 
The air was sweet like honey.
We said our last goodbyes, 
Now what are we becoming?
Outside the blackbirds sing, 
But you keep down the blinds, 
'Cause each time you kiss her lips
They'll sing my lullaby.

[Chorus]
Always look twice

[Bridge]:
Not so long ago, 
Now we are sober and cold
And there's a braver insane
Gotta let all brim
Just gotta let all brim this pain

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
(You played with my heart, 
You ripped it appart)
Always look over your shoulder twice.

Sometimes they wonder
Why I am not afraid
All this thunder
And all this heavy rain
And they wonder
Yes, they wonder
Yeah, they do

Sometimes they wonder
If I will ever break
All these burdens
And all this heavy pain
And they wonder
Yes, they wonder
But I don't

There is a power, not from this world
I found a power, a higher power

I'm walking with an angel (walking with an angel)
I'm talking with an angel too
I'm walking with the angels (walking with the angels)
They pull me through the darkness too

I've been travelling
A dark and deadly road
Sometimes so lonely
But never real alone
No wonder, I've been under
The wings of a godly soul

I tell you secrets
That I found out for sure
I wanna show you
There's help and guidance too
Oh don't wonder, no don't wonder
I can prove that it's true

There is a power, not from this world
I found a power, a higher power

I'm walking with an angel (walking with an angel)
I'm talking with an angel too
I'm walking with the angels (walking with the angels)
And they're watching over me, it's true

There is a power, not from this world
I found a power, a higher power

I'm walking with an angel (walking with an angel)
I'm talking with an angel too
I'm walking with the angels (walking with the angels)
And they're watching over me and you

I'm walking with the angels
I'm walking with the angels

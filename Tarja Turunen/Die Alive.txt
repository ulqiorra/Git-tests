Open up the night.
Led by just a feeling.
All around is light.
Everything is healing.

No more fate
And no more mystery.
Even as time falls away
I live my days
Every moment and it's memory,
Not only to survive: to live alive.

Overwhelming love,
Heaven's just a feeling.
Singing in my blood
Keeping me from kneeling.

No more fate
And no more mystery.
Even as time falls away
I live my days
Every moment and it's memory,
Not only to survive: to live alive.

live alive.

No more fate
And no more mystery.
Even as time falls away
I live my days
Every moment and it's memory,
Not only to survive: to live alive.
